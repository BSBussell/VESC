# VESC
Use an Arduino as a Virtual Electronic Speed Controller

Writen in tandem with VescPy Project this is for use with the Brentwood High School Auto Vechicles class

*NOTE:* I stopped working on this and implemented this into [this repo](https://github.com/BHS-AV/software) so if you want to see what parts were later removed or thrown out of the window check up here.
